# Save The Seas
helpsavetheseas.com

“It is simple. If the oceans die, we die. There is no surviving on this planet with a dead ocean. We are killing the crew that is keeping the very life support systems on this planet functioning.”

This is an informative website that I made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript about the huge negative effects of high sea fishing. I talked about bycatch, bottom trawling, how the food chain works, and how we can help save the oceans. 

Please check it out if you have time, I really hope you read through it and learn something!

This is not neccesary, but I would also really appreciate it if anyone would buy a SaveTheSeas puzzle! (Bottom of the site) All of the proceeds made by that campaign will go straight to a charity dedicated to saving wildlife in the seas.
